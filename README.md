🚀 Create own ML Model and Sentiment analysis in iOS using Swift

As mobile apps scale, backend server costs can quickly become a bottleneck. Fortunately, iOS devices are getting smarter — and with the power of on-device processing, we can shift critical workloads to the user’s device, cutting infrastructure bills while improving performance and privacy. 💡

In this blog, we’ll explore how to optimize server costs by processing data locally on iPhones and iPads.

💸 Why Go Local?
Here’s why local data processing makes sense:

Lower server infrastructure costs 🏷️
Offline functionality 🌐🚫
Instant feedback and low latency ⚡
Enhanced privacy 🔒 (no need to send data to servers)
🧠 Use Case: On-Device Sentiment Analysis
Let’s build a simple sentiment analysis feature where we classify user-generated text (like a review or note) using a Core ML model trained with Create ML.


🛠️ Step 1: Train Your Sentiment Model Using Folders in Create ML

📥 Step 2: Add Model to Xcode

🧪 Step 3: Write a Sentiment Classifier

🧱 Step 4: Create a Simple UI (SwiftUI)


📦 Conclusion
Local data processing is a game changer. Not only does it cut down on cloud expenses, but it also empowers apps to be faster and more respectful of user privacy.

✅ Reduce costs
✅ Delight users
✅ Comply with privacy laws (like GDPR)
